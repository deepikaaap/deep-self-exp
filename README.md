The project is to list a set of inputs into a linked list.

Data will have Value and Index
If the incoming Index is lesser than the head index, the incoming index is made head else is pushed at the end of the list.
If the index already exists, the nodes are swapped and the originally existing node is pushed to the end of the list.
